Usage: zip [-options] [-b path] [-t mmddyyyy] [-n suffixes] [zipfile list] [-xi list] The default action is to add or replace zipfile entries from list, which can include the special name - to compress standard input. If zipfile and list are omitted, zip compresses stdin to stdout. -f freshen: only changed files -u update: only changed or new files -d delete entries in zipfile -m move into zipfile (delete OS files) -r recurse into directories -j junk (don't record) directory names -0 store only -l convert LF to CR LF (-ll CR LF to LF) -1 compress faster -9 compress better -q quiet operation -v verbose operation/print version info -c add one-line comments -z add zipfile comment -@ read names from stdin -o make zipfile as old as latest entry -x exclude the following names -i include only the following names -F fix zipfile (-FF try harder) -D do not add directory entries -A adjust self-extracting exe -J junk zipfile prefix (unzipsfx) -T test zipfile integrity -X eXclude eXtra file attributes -y store symbolic links as the link instead of the referenced file -e encrypt -n don't compress these suffixes -h2 show more help 4. unzip UnZip 6.00 of 20 April 2009, by Info-ZIP. Maintained by C. Spieler. Send bug reports using http://www.info-zip.org/zip-bug.html; see README for details. Usage: unzip [-Z] [-opts[modifiers]] file[.zip] [list] [-x xlist] [-d exdir] Default action is to extract files in list, except those in xlist, to exdir; file[.zip] may be a wildcard. -Z => ZipInfo mode (\"unzip -Z\" for usage). -p extract files to pipe, no messages -l list files (short format) -f freshen existing files, create none -t test compressed archive data -u update files, create if necessary -z display archive comment only -v list verbosely/show version info -T timestamp archive to latest -x exclude files that follow (in xlist) -d extract files into exdir modifiers: -n never overwrite existing files -q quiet mode (-qq => quieter) -o overwrite files WITHOUT prompting -a auto-convert any text files -j junk paths (do not make directories) -aa treat ALL files as text -C match filenames case-insensitively -L make (some) names lowercase -X restore UID/GID info -V retain VMS version numbers -K keep setuid/setgid/tacky permissions -M pipe through \"more\" pager See \"unzip -hh\" or unzip.txt for more help. Examples: unzip data1 -x joe => extract all files except joe from zipfile data1.zip unzip -p foo | more => send contents of foo.zip via pipe into program more unzip -fo foo ReadMe => quietly replace existing ReadMe if archive file newer 5. tar tar(bsdtar): manipulate archive files First option must be a mode specifier: -c Create -r Add/Replace -t List -u Update -x Extract Common Options: -b # Use # 512-byte records per I/O block -f Location of archive -v Verbose -w Interactive Create: tar -c [options] [ | | @ | -C ] , add these items to archive -z, -j, -J, --lzma Compress archive with gzip/bzip2/xz/lzma --format {ustar|pax|cpio|shar} Select archive format --exclude Skip files that match pattern -C Change to before processing remaining files @ Add entries from to output List: tar -t [options] [] If specified, list only entries that match Extract: tar -x [options] [] If specified, extract only entries that match -k Keep (don't overwrite) existing files -m Don't restore modification times -O Write entries to stdout, don't restore to disk -p Restore permissions (including ACLs, owner, file flags) bsdtar 3.3.2 - libarchive 3.3.2 zlib/1.2.11 liblzma/5.0.5 bz2lib/1.0.6 5.1 Enrypt tar files: tar -zcvf - stuff|openssl des3 -salt -k secretpassword | dd of=stuff.des3 You will get a file named \"stuff.des3\", in which des3 means a triple-encryption algorithm. And you should replace \"secretpassword\" as your password. 5.2 Unencrypt tar files: dd if=stuff.des3 |openssl des3 -d -k secretpassword|tar zxf - Note that there is a \"-\" at the last that means tar will release all files unencrypted form previous process via pipe.
